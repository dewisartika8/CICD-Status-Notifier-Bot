  - Event-based communication (project updates, build events, notifications)
  - Automatic subscription management for projects
- ✅ Custom useWebSocket hook:
  - Redux integration for real-time state updates
  - Automatic notification dispatch for build events
  - Connection lifecycle management
  - Tab visibility detection for reconnection

**WebSocket Features:**
- Real-time project status updates
- Live build event notifications
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Connection status indicator in header
- Project-specific subscription management
- Integration with notification system

### 🔧 Technical Architecture

#### State Management
```typescript
// Redux Store Structure
{
  projects: {
    projects: Project[],
    currentProject: Project | null,
    status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed',
    error: string | null
  },
  ui: {
    theme: ThemeConfig,
    sidebarOpen: boolean,
    websocketConnected: boolean,
    loading: { dashboard: boolean, projects: boolean, builds: boolean },
    errors: { dashboard: string | null, ... }
  },
  notifications: {
    notifications: Notification[],
    unreadCount: number
  }
}
```

#### Component Architecture
- Layout-based design with Material-UI components
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Type-safe props and state management
- Reusable components with consistent styling
- Error boundary implementation for graceful failures

#### Real-time Architecture
- WebSocket connection with automatic reconnection
- Event-driven updates for project and build status
- Integration with Redux for state synchronization
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Connection status monitoring

### 🎨 UI/UX Features

#### Design System
- Material-UI v5 with custom theme configuration
- Light/dark mode toggle with persistent preference
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Consistent color scheme and typography
- Loading states and skeleton components

#### User Experience
- Real-time status updates without page refresh
- Toast notifications for important events
- Progressive loading with skeleton screens
- Error boundaries with user-friendly messages
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility support
