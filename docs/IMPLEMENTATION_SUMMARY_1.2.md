### Design Principles Applied
1. **Dependency Inversion:** Domain doesn't depend on infrastructure
2. **Single Responsibility:** Each component has one clear purpose
3. **Open/Closed:** Easy to extend without modifying existing code
4. **Interface Segregation:** Clean, focused interfaces
5. **Don't Repeat Yourself:** Reusable components and utilities
